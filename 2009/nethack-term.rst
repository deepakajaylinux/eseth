Working on a computer for twelve hours a day can be an extraordinarily solitary
existence. That is why I decided I needed the companionship of the faithful,
selfless, and brave :rc:`dog from Nethack in my shell prompt
<.zsh_shouse_prompt>`.

Also, a full-width delimiter really helps visually separate commands from one
another which speeds my terminal sessions—but mostly it’s the companionship
thing.
