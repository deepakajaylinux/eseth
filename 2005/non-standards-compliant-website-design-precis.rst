Non-standards compliant website design précis
=============================================

:pubdate: 2005-01-26

Often when trying to evangelize web standards I use a friend’s
non-compliant website to offer a comparison in methodologies. Recently I
came across a bookmarklet
<http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/favelets/>
that outlines deprecated or poor use of various HTML tags and tried it
on his site. Josh
<http://www.ejoshua.com/> is
going to hate me for posting this screenshot, but I thought it was funny.

Everything outlined in red or green is an error.

    That is awesome! I never did like the layout and ease-of-use of his
    website. But like so many in our industry and field, we never update our
    own websites. It’s a pitty, really. But that is definetly funny.

    Fabulous! Simply fabulous! My site wasn’t nearly as interesting as Josh’s
    with the error checking css. ;)
