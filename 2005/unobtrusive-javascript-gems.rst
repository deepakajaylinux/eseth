I'm diving in to ECMAScript for the first time, inspired by DOM Scripting
(also called Unobtrusive JavaScript). As a web designer of a handful of years
resorting to scripting has always left a bad aftertaste in my mouth, not so
with these new techniques. Here's a quick list of examples that have
impressed me as I've been researching. (Not all of them fully comply with the
ideals of unobtrusive script, but those that don't could easily be.)

-   `Client-side table sorting`_
-   `Client-side table striping`_
-   `Automatic page TOC generation`_
-   `Display blockquote 'cite' attribute & how to make tabbed sections by
    hiding/showing blocks`_
-   `Permanent anchor links to paragraphs`_
-   `Better date formatting`_
-   `Nasty drop down menus done right`_
-   `Edit any text on a page`_

    I particularly liked the page about YADM (nasty drop down menuses).
    Consider this gem from the page:

        Working with other scripts If YADM were a pupil, its yearbook would
        sport a smiley face stating "plays well with others". There are no
        global variables or functions outside the main function yadm and you
        can easily add your own functions to the onload construct at the bottom
        of the script.
