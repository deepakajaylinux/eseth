<dd><p class="first">First idea for discussion: Tribes: Vengeance
<a class="reference external" href="http://gamespot.com/pc/action/tribesvengeance/">http://gamespot.com/pc/action/tribesvengeance/</a></p>
<p>None of us have ever played a Tribes game, dispite a pretty rabid cult
following. That means no familiarity with maps, weapons, and whathaveyou.
Eye-ball the Gamespot video review
<a class="reference external" href="http://gamespot.com/pc/action/tribesvengeance/media.html">http://gamespot.com/pc/action/tribesvengeance/media.html</a>. We could alll
pick it up for $20 <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ebgames.com/ebx/product/235213.asp">http://www.ebgames.com/ebx/product/235213.asp</a> (or maybe
less locally). However, maybe that&#8217;s too much for a game we&#8217;ll likely never
play after the party.</p>
<p>Second idea for discussion: Star Wars: Battlefront
<a class="reference external" href="http://gamespot.com/pc/action/starwarsbattlefront/">http://gamespot.com/pc/action/starwarsbattlefront/</a></p>
<p>Battlefield 1942 made a pretty decent impression on everyone at a previous
LAN. Star Wars: Battlefront is the exact same game, but Star Wars.</p>
<p>Third idea for discussion: Defense of the Ancients <a class="reference external" href="http://www.dota-allstars.com/">http://www.dota-allstars.com/</a></p>
<p class="last">DotA, a Warcraft III mod, can be spectacularly fun but has a steep learning
curve. It&#8217;s likely that through the course of the week we&#8217;ll have enough
people to flesh out a whole team. We can have printed quick reference sheets
available which will greatly help with familiarity.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Seth</dt>
<dd><p class="first">I have recieved a request for the complete and total lack of dungeon
crawlersand MMORPGs. A counter idea I heard would be to set aside certain
days of the party for certain games so you would know what to expect
before-hand.</p>
<p class="last"><em>Make yourselves heard!</em></p>
</dd>
<dt>Seth</dt>
<dd>Food is another issue that creates a lot of downtime and dissension. Would
everyone be ok with a door charge? If so, what kinds of food would everyone
want? Peanut butter and jelly? Frozen burritos and ramen? What else? We
could have a microwave downstairs.</dd>
<dt>Tzeench</dt>
<dd><p class="first">Let me be the first non-Seth person to applaud the noble efforts of
efficiency (but not spelling, on my part). Hear, hear!</p>
<p>I vote that people eat beforehand and/or bring their own food; much time
can be wasted running around and picking up fast food. If we have a Grocer,
like Seth, we should definately have a door charge for the food. Last time
we did this, very few people paid him back and that was total bullshit.
Money up front.</p>
<p>I think Gatt&#8217;s idea of certain days being flagged as ok for certain
contentious game types (dungeon crawl, RTS, etc) is good. People can skip
those days if they work or have shit to do and don&#8217;t like what&#8217;s on the
menu.</p>
<p>I want to hear what people think of various FPS modes, especially UT &#8216;04.
We tend to do CTF on like 4 maps for 14 hr. when we do it, which gets
tiresome. I&#8217;m game for Double Domination, Onslaught, Instagib CTF, Team
Deathmatch and Bombing Run. Am I the only one who wants to play these?</p>
<p>For Dugeon Crawl Day (if it ends up existing), we should do 1-2 instances
in WoW. Mauradon and the Sunken Temple have been suggested. Anyone
interested in those, or have other ideas?</p>
<p>For food, everything Seth said sounds good. Frozen pizzas also sound good.
We could actually (gasp and shock!) cook a butt-ton of pasta and ground
hamburger (1/2 assed meatballs) or sausage (turkey, for Gatton) to put in
it. It would be more work but yummier. If that sounds like a disaster
waiting to happen, let&#8217;s not do it.</p>
<p>The games above look good to me, I have no problems with any of them. If
some people want to do regular Warcraft Arranged Team that might be fun, or
we could fight each other. Also, my posse liked Rise of Nations well
enough, so if you have that bring it just in case the mood strikes during
RTS Day.</p>
<p class="last">That&#8217;s all I got for now. Let&#8217;s rock the party.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Faggot Ass Nigger</dt>
<dd>Tzeentch and i have randomly decided we want to play this game
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.gamespot.com/pc/adventure/damewasloaded/">http://www.gamespot.com/pc/adventure/damewasloaded/</a></dd>
<dt>Luke</dt>
<dd>I&#8217;m definitely in a Dota way these days; you probably won&#8217;t get me for
anything else.</dd>
<dt>Brandon</dt>
<dd><p class="first">I for one am really looking forward to trying out Tribes: Vengence. From
what I know of the tribes games, they have a much larger strategic element
than most run and gun FPSs, but still play fast like UT. The system reqs
won&#8217;t kill us, and I think $20 isn&#8217;t a bad investment.</p>
<p>SW: Battlefront would be a good time, I think, but I&#8217;m not sure that we
should try for both it and Tribes. The $50 price tag is the kicker there. I
can see myself playing tribes after the party, but Battlefront would
probably just collect dust.</p>
<p>DotA is a given. I like the game, and It&#8217;ll probably make a great
side-game. Moonbase Commander is another great side-game.</p>
<p>What we&#8217;re lacking is a good cooperatlive game. The problem with those is
that you need the same people around every time you continue. If anyone can
think of any good ones, though, I&#8217;d love to hear about it.</p>
<p>It hasn&#8217;t been mentioned here yet, so I thought that I&#8217;d talk about a
Firefly screening. Seth and I have been planning on watching all 14
episodes, in the weeks before the release of Serenity (the Firefly movie).
We thought the LAN party might be a good place to start with the pilot.</p>
<p class="last">If you havn&#8217;t seen any Firefly yet, just know that its a great sci-fi
television series. I&#8217;d like to hear what people think about watching the
pilot, and maybe a couple more episodes.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Seth</dt>
<dd><p class="first">Firefly, yeah definitely.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like it to be more than just downtime filler too (again, if people are
interested), it&#8217;d be nice to spend two or three hours one night, or maybe
an hour a night.</p>
<p class="last">If you haven&#8217;t seen &#8216;em you&#8217;re in for a treat. It&#8217;s Joss Wheadon writing
though so in order to appreciate it you have to pay attention (ie. we
couldn&#8217;t play and watch).</p>
</dd>
<dt>Big Daddy Gatt</dt>
<dd><p class="first">Planning for food is definately a good plan, i&#8217;ve also talked to seth about
a possible BBQ on Friday, the menu would be some seriously tasty steaks
from Costco. If we are interested enough to get a pot of $ going for food
we could feasibly get Ribeyes for everyone if all that are interested will
chip in 7 or 8 bucks. If you have not had a costco ribeye i strongly
recommend taking advantage of this opportunity bitches, I will play grill
master so y&#8217;all can game until it&#8217;s ready then we&#8217;ll all go in the yard and
get our grub on, if you are interested call my cell phone and leave a
message, or text me or send me some WoW mail, i&#8217;d really like to get this
going it would be a nice change from the totaly shit we&#8217;ll be eating the
rest of the week. Also i don&#8217;t know how it could have gone unsaid, but we
need Redvines, and belive me we will have a costco tub of them.</p>
<p>I definately don&#8217;t want to buy any 50$ games and i doubt i&#8217;m alone on this,
if we can use &#8216;alternate methods&#8217; to cop SW then i&#8217;m down i think it will
be fun. I believe Harrigan is working on a solution as i type this.</p>
<p>DotA will be TONS of fun so i&#8217;m really looking forward to this.</p>
<p>As far as co-op goes i think the best thing would be WoW for most of us,
sunken temple would be good, also some of us still have <em>cough</em> Uldaman to
worry about.</p>
<p>UT is a given, i&#8217;m am happy to play most game types.</p>
<p>Q3 also has some wicked fun DM.</p>
<p>If my availability comes into question i should have thursday through
saturday off.</p>
<p class="last">&#8216;I got the magic stick, i know if i can hit once, i can hit twice&#8217;.&#8216;50 cent
(in reference to the BDG)</p>
</dd>
<dt>Faggot Ass Nigger</dt>
<dd><p class="first">I agree with Red Vines. If any of you dicklickers try to push those douchy
gummy bears down our gullets again, i will fist your mothers until she has
knuckles for teeth.</p>
<p class="last">Oh, and yes, Firefly is cool.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Faggot Ass Nigger</dt>
<dd><p class="first">DotA as a &#8216;side-game&#8217; Brandon&#8217; Surely you jest. Front and fucking center.</p>
<p class="last">When you all say a &#8216;cooperative&#8217; game, do you mean like an RPG? I mean, all
of these team games are cooperative?. Are you looking for something that
saves your progress from day to day and progresses, like Serious Sam or
Dungeon Seige?</p>
</dd>
<dt>Faggot Ass Nigger</dt>
<dd>For the record, the last post was not me. some stupid imposter who writes
like Seth aparently.</dd>
<dt>Seth</dt>
<dd><p class="first">Sorry for the impersonation. You have to admit that was a pretty good Seth
pretending to be Joe pretending to be Seth, though.</p>
<p>By cooperative I think we mean Serious Sam-ish cooperative single player.
With some of the games like DotA and SW: Battlefield if we&#8217;re all on the
same side then it accomplishes what we&#8217;re hoping for. With Tribes or UT
we&#8217;ll only be fighting (sometimes gay) bots or each other.</p>
<p class="last">Incidentally, there&#8217;s a Serious Sam 2 in the works due out this Fall or
Winter, so plan on a celebratory LAN party just for that.</p>
</dd>
<dt>bobzrkr</dt>
<dd><p class="first">For all of you who want to play Tribes, I&#8217;ve found it for $17.50
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.newegg.com/OldVersion/app/ViewProductDesc.asp'description=32-202-007&amp;depa=6">http://www.newegg.com/OldVersion/app/ViewProductDesc.asp&#8217;description=32-202-007&amp;depa=6</a>
plus shipping.</p>
<p class="last">Another option I would like to all to consider is this
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.newegg.com/OldVersion/app/viewproductdesc.asp?description=32-128-127&amp;DEPA=6">http://www.newegg.com/OldVersion/app/viewproductdesc.asp?description=32-128-127&amp;DEPA=6</a>,
I&#8217;ve heard Deathmatch on it is really fun. The game is only $30, and
there&#8217;s a fair amount of mods for it.</p>
</dd>
<dt>bobzrkr</dt>
<dd><p class="first">and obviously I don&#8217;t know how to code html? Seth, Could you fix that last
post for me? maybe? please? the other game I wanted ya&#8217;ll to consider wat
Half-Life 2, which is only $30.</p>
<p class="last"><em>Seth edit</em>: np, buddy. Halflife 2 for $30 really isn&#8217;t bad at all. I&#8217;m
sure I&#8217;d get around to it at some point, maybe this is a good opportunity.
How does everyone else feel about it? BoB, what kind of multiplayer
(non-mod and with-mod) options are available? Other than Counter Strike
Source I mean.</p>

<p>The meeting went well, I think we covered most everything. The above page has
been updated to reflect the decisions made.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="new-game-idea">
<h2>New Game Idea</h2>
<p>How would everyone feel about resurecting Savage <a class="reference external" href="http://www.s2games.com/savage/">http://www.s2games.com/savage/</a>
? Last Week Long we tried an /early/ build and did not have many people
playing, the game is much better now and we could get a pretty big game going
if we focused our efforts. Featuring both RTS and FPS elements, it has the
potential to really make this party. It&#8217;s available from the official site for
a $20 downloadable version.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Big Daddy Gatt</dt>
<dd>I think that savage would be a really good idea, this game is seriously fun
and if we have the people power for it, it could easily dominate this lan
party in the fashion of the original UT or Serious Sam in years past.
Please try to get some feedback posted either positive or negative on this
one so we can get this going.</dd>
<dt>Smudo</dt>
<dd><p class="first">Thanks for the invite <em>bitch!</em> Not that I would have gone anyway, I&#8217;ll be
at eBay Live in San Jose. But I totally would have gone if you had asked?
except for, oh yeah right, who the crap plays games? What are all of you,
12 year olds?</p>
<p class="last">(I&#8217;m not talking about you though big Gatt, I&#8217;d take your adorable little
figure bent over a barrel ;-)</p>
</dd>
<dt>Seth</dt>
<dd>A cool thing about Gatt&#8217;s massive wang is you don&#8217;t have to bend him over
anything, you can just bend him over himself!</dd>
<dt>Tzeentch</dt>
<dd><p class="first">Savage, eh? I liked that game the first 2 times we tried it, but i agree
that its Early Build Quotient was somewhere between lame and horrible.
Melee combat was a joke, only humans were playable ? the whole game felt
unpolished, unbalanced, and harder than it needed to be to do simple things
(can i get a &#8216;hell yeah&#8217; for idle workers not being shown, repairing
requiring you to hit the attack button 600 times, poor item funtionality in
many cases, and uninformative rollover text?).</p>
<p class="last">But i really liked the idea of Savage. It seemed like a dream come true for
LAN parties, what with the multiple elements involved. If the game doesn&#8217;t
suck anymore, i&#8217;d play.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Faggot Ass Nigger</dt>
<dd>Hell yeah.</dd>
<dt>Turbo</dt>
<dd>Count me in on friday for food. Let me know if I can bring anything.</dd>
<dt>Lu</dt>
<dd><p class="first">I&#8217;m just a nobody who stumbled on the site, and obviously I am not part of
your l33t circle, but i gotta say this lan party is the most outrageous
geek- fest i&#8217;ve ever seen.</p>
<p>You might want to throw ina game of ultimate or something in there, i mean
just sanity&#8217;s sake.</p>
