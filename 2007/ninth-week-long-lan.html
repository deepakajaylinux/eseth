<p id="index-0">Prepare yourselves for the Ninth Annual Week(end)-Long LAN Party!</p>
<p>It will be July 6-8th.</p>
<div class="section" id="instructions">
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>The head-count is nine people in total, which may drop to six or seven after
Friday. Friday night will be classic UT night since a few people are coming
out specifically for that. The rest of the party will be unstructured.</p>
<p>We will be starting early and ending early for a change; we&#8217;ll probably go
from pre-noon until two in the morning (or so). For those of you not spending
the night, get the fuck up to my place in the A.M.! We&#8217;ll have enough food
for lunch.</p>
<div class="section" id="food">
<h3>Food</h3>
<p>Complementary catering will be provided by Casa de los Casa. We&#8217;ll have
barbecued chicken, potato salad, cold sandwiches, peanut butter, and frozen
burritos. Bring a few bucks for pizza on Friday night, and maybe one other
occasion (Saturday night?). Also, if you&#8217;re so inclined, bring your own beer
(and maybe one for a friend).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="sleeping-arrangements">
<h3>Sleeping Arrangements</h3>
<p>Bring a blankey (and a pillow, change of clothes, toothbrush, etc.). We&#8217;ll
provide towels, and hidden cams for showering.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="equipment-gaming-space">
<h3>Equipment &amp; Gaming Space</h3>
<p>I will provide internet, extension cables and ethernet cables, as usual.
Also, I have plenty of table space so just bring your shit and a comfy chair.
I have a bunch of chairs, but they&#8217;re all of the metal-and-folding variety.</p>
<p>I have one television, if there&#8217;s to be dual-consoling of any sort, I&#8217;ll need
someone to bring another.</p>

<dt>Joe</dt>
<dd>This is all well and good, but i just read an article about a guy named
Gary Feltch. Check it out on page B8 of Thursday&#8217;s Tribune!</dd>
<dt>Captain Fish Clits</dt>
<dd><p class="first">If you play WoW, I&#8217;m sure the illustrious Luke will not be able to join in,
since you&#8217;ll all be doing level 70 stuff. Jerks.</p>
<p class="last">But maybe he won&#8217;t be in town, anyway.</p>
</dd>
<dt>whiteinge</dt>
<dd>Gatt, Beatty and I haven&#8217;t done any post-60 stuff. Maybe something like a
mass lowbie push would be fun. Like two three-or-four-man groups comprised
entirely of Draenei Pallys (or something similar).</dd>
<dt>whiteinge</dt>
<dd>There&#8217;s gotta be a non-WoW game out there that&#8217;s worth playing, but it
seems that every single one of us is either out of the loop, or playing
WoW. Quick! Everyone ask their nephews what all the cool kids are playing
these days.</dd>
<dt>MILKM3PLZ</dt>
<dd><p class="first">So, I think that focusing on WoW isn&#8217;t going to work super well. We
probably aren&#8217;t going to have a five people willing/able to do a 5 man
group, esp. considering Gatt and Beatty don&#8217;t play. I think we should kick
it old school. Get some lava giant, get some facing worlds, get some Q3 DM,
warcraft III (not that we&#8217;ve ever actually played it), DotA, look for some
cools mods to the aformentioned games, smash bros, guitar hero, maybe
something for the Wii, dawn of war (?), command and conquer 3 (?), rise of
nations (?), moonbase commander (?), diablo II (sullivan/jason, im looking
at you), tribes?I&#8217;m sure we won&#8217;t all want to or be able to play the same
stuff at the same time, so I think we shouldn&#8217;t even worry about trying. We
spend too much time trying to get everyone on the same page playing the
same thing?with only a weekend, I say &#8220;fuck it.&#8221; Let&#8217;s just have a fun time
hanging out and tandem gaming. I see nothing wrong with four people hitting
Gnomregan while we have a person playing amplitude, a person watching
amplitude, a couple of people pwning in DotA, and a couple people sparring
in WCIII.</p>
<p class="last">That being said, I&#8217;d still like to - if possible - play CTF or DM with
most/all of the participants at least once or twice. I just don&#8217;t think
making a huge effort to get everyone on the same thing is going to work or
will be fun.</p>
</dd>
<dt>whiteinge</dt>
<dd>I think James&#8217; suggestion is great. Also, the majority of us have chicks
atm, so bring &#8216;em if you got &#8216;em (chicks dig consoles)! The more the
merrier. (Previous statement updated for slightly less sexism.)</dd>
<dt>Joe</dt>
<dd>Facing worlds is awesome. Do they have modern flush-toilets up there in
Ogden? If they do we should try to fill the bowl up with piss.</dd>
<dt>Gatt</dt>
<dd>Beatty is definately on the right track with the piss idea. In fact, let&#8217;s
forget the games and just drink coke and coffee for three days and see if
we can fill the bathtub instead. Additionally I don&#8217;t really like the idea
of us all jacking off doing our own thing, it sort of takes away from the
idea of the LAN party. I do see James&#8217;s point and if we do tandem gamin
I&#8217;ll try not to be a little girl about it, I would just like to think of a
way to get as many people on the same page as we can. Hopefully that will
be taken care of because we will find a new game that is so awesome nobody
wants to even think about anything else. I remembered that I have a friend
at work who games a ton with his brothers over LAN and Jon also seems to
keep up pretty well on this stuff, so I will check with both of them.</dd>
<dt>Jason</dt>
<dd>I too do not play WoW. But, I will try to make an apearance this year. No
school or work makes it easier.</dd>
<dt>Brandon</dt>
<dd><p class="first">I&#8217;d like to play: 1. Either starcraft or dawn of war. I&#8217;ve had an itch for
some old school starcraft ever since Jason asked for my cd key, and I don&#8217;t
think we ever gave dawn of war a fair go. I think that if we play an RTS,
it should be one of these two.</p>
<ol class="last arabic simple">
<li>Tribes or one of the UTs. I thought tribes was awesome, but botless. If
we are willing to take our sorry asses online, we should give it a go.
If we don&#8217;t want to humiliate ourselves against strangers, we should
make ourselves feel good by beating a team of UT bots.</li>
<li>DotA. The all tiny match we did was cool, even though this game sucks.</li>
<li>Console stuff. I&#8217;ll make sure that guitar hero is there, and I&#8217;d like
to try out something for the wii.</li>
<li>Not WoW, at least if we can help it. I really don&#8217;t want to start
another alt, and we play it all the time anyway. If we really want to
do an MMO, it might be fun to hop onto a trial of middle earth online
(assuming they offer a trial, most MMOs do). That stint we did with the
D&amp;D MMO was a good time.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dt>MILKM3PLZ</dt>
<dd><p class="first">I agree with most of the comments so far. I hope Gatt finds a game that&#8217;s
so fun everyone just wants to play it and nothing else because that&#8217;s what
makes LAN parties super stellar. Such a game is not always availible,
however, as we&#8217;ve found in the past. If we want to all play the same thing,
which I will agree is ideal but based on past experiences doesn&#8217;t always
happen, we need to set up a schedule for playing certain games at certain
times or unanimously agree to make the LAN party about one game. People
have found the idea of scheduling restrictive in the past, but LAN parties
work better if everyone isn&#8217;t a chaotic mob. I would agree that being a
chaotic mob is fun if we all hop from game to game <em>together</em>
spontaneously, but that hasn&#8217;t really happened for years and I think we
should not gamble on that. I don&#8217;t feel that much, if anything, is taken
away from the LAN party experience by organizing things.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like for console gaming to happen. GFs like it, and guitar hero and
amplitude are popular. Since consoles are 1-4 players we may have to
CONSOLE gatton, but I think the LAN party would be poorer without them.</p>
<p>I really WANT to like dawn of war. I&#8217;d like to try that again, esp. if we
can steal some expansions. Multiplayer starcraft is inferior to warcraft
III, but I know that you pussies can&#8217;t manage heroes effectively so I will
happily zerg your faces. Also, my GF may play.</p>
<p>I like UT! It&#8217;s still fun, and I don&#8217;t know why we ever put it down at
LANs. LAVA GIANT FTW!</p>
<p>I can make another DotA questionnaire, and we can play a limited number of
matches with fun rules (all pudge, all tiny, all rikimaru, -ardmscnpmmduid,
etc). I think that will satisfy the people who want to play DotA &#8220;for real&#8221;
and the people who secretly like it but can&#8217;t stand that they suck at it.</p>
<p>Starting an MMO a la D&amp;D online might be fun, but perhaps ONLY if it&#8217;s D&amp;D
online. We already know how the game works, the rules, the strats, etc to
some extent, and my concern is that if we play an another MMO we&#8217;ll spend
12 hours running around trying to figure out how to find our way out of
town or open the quest log or equip our pants. I also enjoyed the way D&amp;D
online was presented and how the game worked. I think it would be a fun
experience to play through that game for 8-16 hours with a static and
balanced group. The disadvantage is that doing that would only be for a
certain number of people and adding more later would probably be hard
(quest pre-reqs, level reqs, etc). Also, we&#8217;ve already played through it
for awhile before so it would take some of our very limited time to
actually access new content. We could theoretically start single player
accounts a week before (the trial is 10 days?) and get to level 4 or
something, so we can start right off - maybe also read some strat guide so
we aren&#8217;t wasting time running around lost after we&#8217;re done with the
content we remember.</p>
<p class="last">WoW can suck it for the duration of this party.</p>
</dd>
<dt>MILKM3PLZ</dt>
<dd>With apologies to Seth, here&#8217;s another thing I want to mention as early as
possible: most of us don&#8217;t live in Ogden. In the absence of the traditional
house, I want to try to find a place in SLC at which we can do this since
most people live here. I know some people in my IT dept. do LANing, so I
can ask them if we can use their space or if they have an unused building
somewhere. It doesn&#8217;t make a lot of sense to me to hold this party so far
away from most of the participants unless we have to.</dd>
<dt>whiteinge</dt>
<dd><p class="first">With apologies to James, fuck your apology: none of you live in Ogden.</p>
<p class="last">Since we&#8217;re gaming over a weekend instead of the traditional week, I felt a
sleepover might be a good way to maximize time. If the sleepover is a no-go
then driving to-and-from Ogden every day is silly. So what say you (all) to
the sleepover?</p>
</dd>
<dt>MILKM3PLZ</dt>
<dd>Myself, I don&#8217;t want to sleep over. I don&#8217;t tolerate alterations to my
sleep patterns well and I think it would be a logistical ass-fest to manage
contact lens, showering, toothbrushing, bedding, food, and People Awake
Gaming vs. People Asleep. Jenn has a lot of friends at Xmission, maybe they
can hook us up.</dd>
<dt>Matt</dt>
<dd><p class="first">Dang! I just missed the cutoff for the sleepover. Craptacular!</p>
<p class="last">On a serious note, has anyone played any XMP lately? I understand there is
a mod for UT2k4 that does XMP, but I haven&#8217;t followed its progress for
ages. There should at least be some traditional LAN fragfest &#8211;all the
better with vehicles of various kinds.</p>
</dd>
<dt>MILKM3PLZ</dt>
<dd>What&#8217;s XMP?</dd>
<dt>whiteinge</dt>
<dd>Unreal II: Expanded Multiplayer <a class="reference external" href="http://www.free-monkey.com/main/utxmp.php">http://www.free-monkey.com/main/utxmp.php</a></dd>
<dt>MILKM3PLZ</dt>
<dd>I&#8217;m not sure if anyone besides Seth and I read this, anymore?</dd>
<dt>Thais</dt>
<dd>Hello - For the ones who would stay and not cry at night, I&#8217;ll make sure
you are all well fed. We&#8217;ll even toss some steak on the menu. I am
accepting suggestions for the menu by the way. For the ones who would cry
at night and need to sleep on their nice and soft bed, the ride to Ogden
from downtown Salt Lake is just fine, it takes me 10 from downtown to the
I-89 exit and 15 minutes from I-89 to our house. Since you guys are doing
this on a weekend, there is no traffic. Please come, we are excited to have
you guys over.</dd>
<dt>Joe</dt>
<dd>Who the hell is Matt?</dd>
<dt>whiteinge</dt>
<dd><p class="first">Matt is an uber-cool friend, and once (and hopefully future) co- worker
that I met while working with Carson&#8217;s older brother (also uber- cool).</p>
<p class="last">Incidentally, I&#8217;m not one to respect laws that I personally find
undesirable; if Nat and Matt were to show up for the LAN, I would not turn
them in to the age-police?</p>
</dd>
<dt>whiteinge</dt>
<dd>I don&#8217;t know how much i like the &#8220;lets design this around GFs&#8221; idea. (Thais
can come since its her house) They might like consoles, but its more of a
&#8220;whee, that was a fun ten minutes&#8221; kind of like, then they will be hanging
around and distracting from UT and we won&#8217;t actually get any gaming
accomplished. And the queef stench will be unbearable.</dd>
<dt>whiteinge</dt>
<dd>Perhaps they can pepper their gaming spurts with excursions to the local
discount shoe-shop, as well as chat amongst themselves in that
high-pitched, super-velocity chick language while they make us sandwiches</dd>
<dt>Brandon</dt>
<dd><p class="first">Ok, to sum things up:</p>
<p>This will be 7/06(friday) through 7/08(sunday). I&#8217;ll likely be setting my
stuff up on thursday, and I&#8217;d suggest that others do the same. Whoever
shows up late friday, only to find out that they need to do major
patching/harware fixing, owes $100 to each LANer that set up early.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll be doing this at Seth&#8217;s house in Ogden. Travel times will be a
hassle, but not as bad as some have made it out to be. The main advantage
is that Seth has total control of the building, and we can keep whatever
hours we want. Sleepover sounds good to me, but if people don&#8217;t want to do
that, a half-hour drive each way isn&#8217;t anything to worry about. Oh, and we
get Thais catering service.</p>
<p class="last">For games, it seems like there is a good amount of interest in Dawn of War.
If anybody wants to play online before the LAN party, that&#8217;d rock. I own
the game, and the latest patch eliminates the CD check, so I can hook you
up. FPS-wise, I think original UT is the way to go. Everybody&#8217;s computer
can handle it, and it was featured at our alltime best LAN parties.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Gatt</dt>
<dd>Well it appears things are shaping up just as i had planned. James and Seth
plan the LAN party with occasional input from Brandon and Beatty covers the
jokes. Why did you need me to post?</dd>
<dt>whiteinge</dt>
<dd><p class="first">How the hell else would we know everything&#8217;s on track if you didn&#8217;t let us
know, Gatt? Geez!</p>
<p>Actually, we need you to handle the meat.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to do a Brazilian barbecue once or maybe twice over the weekend.
Maybe an expensive one that everyone chips in for (like last year) on
Saturday, and a cheaper one on Sunday (ribs, or something).</p>
<p class="last">Think you can hook us up with some choice cuts of horse meat, Gatt?</p>
</dd>
<dt>MILKM3PLZ</dt>
<dd><p class="first">Hey, I can finally access this page. Joy. Maybe I can take that Friday off,
too, and set up Thursday like my bestest friend in the whole world Brandon.</p>
<p>I guess I&#8217;ll stop trying to find a place to do this closer to SLC, since I
seem to be largely reviled for trying to save time and cut down on
logistical cocksmackery. How dare I.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s wrong with having consoles, again? I don&#8217;t think any of our GF&#8217;s
like FPS&#8217;s, but I think it will be fun to have them there.</p>
<p>Yay Dawn of War. Please install it and patch it. If you all wait until the
day of the LAN to install and patch with only Brandon&#8217;s (and maybe Jason&#8217;s)
CD, we will never play games together because it takes awhile.</p>
<p>BEFORE THE WEEK OF THE LAN, if you want to play WCIII, Dawn of War, Unreal
Tournament (the first one), Diablo, Rise of Nations, Quake III, Starcraft,
etc:</p>
<ol class="last arabic simple">
<li>If you have the disk, please FIND the thing before you are about to
leave for Ogden.</li>
<li>Please have the game installed.</li>
<li>Join an internet game, again and again, until you&#8217;re done patching.</li>
<li>Test the game to make sure it runs with your video card, sound card,
network card, playing card, yellow card, green card, nutsack card, etc.
so we don&#8217;t have to deal with that bullshit on LAN time. Actually play
a game vs. the computer or something, don&#8217;t just see if you can start a
game.</li>
<li>Expect that relying on burned disks and boot disks may be chancey, and
it may not work. &#8212;&gt;If you lack disks and don&#8217;t know people who have
them, call around or post here so we can get you hooked up.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dt>MILKM3PLZ</dt>
<dd>Well, that&#8217;s a solid brick of text. Too bad the spaces I put in there
didn&#8217;t work, and I can&#8217;t edit my post. Suck it.</dd>
<dt>whiteinge</dt>
<dd>I got your back with the formatting, yo. (The afore-mentioned reviling
notwithstanding.) Not that anyone will follow your instructions, anyway.
(Erik! That&#8217;s you!)</dd>
<dt>MILKM3PLZ</dt>
<dd>Yes, I&#8217;m sure Erik won&#8217;t, because he is a pile of lame. So, Sullivan and I
would really like to play WCIII (in addition to DotA) with other people at
the party. Are any of you brave enough to learn how to play appreciate the
game?</dd>
<dt>whiteingeh</dt>
<dd><p class="first">Why play WCIII when we could instead play an <em>actual</em> Blizzard RTS?</p>
<p class="last">j/k. I&#8217;m up for whatever. (And by &#8220;whatever&#8221; I&#8217;m referring to whatever
genre WCIII is in.)</p>

<dt>MILKM3PLZ</dt>
<dd>If you (or anyone else) want to improve your WCIII skills and learn why you
can&#8217;t play it like StarCraft, I can help you with some easy ways to play
better and get into the right mind frame. We can play a 1v1 or two against
each other online, then 2v2 vs. comps, etc. I&#8217;m happy to provide that
service. Same goes for Dawn of War, excluding Eldar and Orks.</dd>
<dt>Joe</dt>
<dd>I want to play WCIII. can we play the &#8220;footies&#8221; map that pops up on the
battlenet server listings?</dd>
<dt>Jose</dt>
<dd>Todo me suena muy bien todav?a. Puedo coger la carne. Tuvimos backribs en
la barbacoa de buen viaje y estaban muy ricos. ?Que mas carne quiere?
?Ribeye otra vez? O si prefieres, Seth, puedo matar un caballo de mis
cumpa?eros de trabajo y traer esa carne. Thais, debes decir a tu perezoso
esposo que ?l tenga que aprender portugues entonces el puede leer los
mensajes de Jos? y tengo por lo menos alg?n idea lo que diga yo, sin pedir
la ayuda tuya. Ademas joda WCIII en su culo.</dd>
<dt>whiteinge</dt>
<dd><p class="first">Google&#8217;s highly accurate translation of the above comment:</p>
<blockquote class="last">
<div>All it very well still sounds to me. I can take the meat. We had
backribs in the barbecue of have a good travel and were very rich. That
but meat it wants? Ribeye again? Or if you prefer, Seth, I can kill a
horse of my cumpa?eros of work and bring that meat. Thais, you must say
to your sluggish husband who he must learn then Portuguese can read the

<dt>MILKM3PLZ</dt>
<dd>Footies is a map that is, I believe, designed to help people learn how to
micro.</dd>
<dt>Joe</dt>
<dd>what about the jurassic park map?</dd>
<dt>Jose</dt>
<dd>To be honest, I?m impressed at how well that translation turned out. It was
wrong a lot, but that was based on context and the back asswards spanish
syntax, which made the whole thing sound pretty fucking funny. Also that
tengo at the end should have been tener, my bad. Anyway, they gist was that
I?ll bring meat, I just wondered what kind specifically you wanted, and
suggested that &#8220;in the barbecue of have a good travel&#8221; we had some tasty
backribs which we could get again. Dawn of War sounds more appealing to me
than Warcraft III, because I already know that the AI sucks in WCIII and I
hate playing against human opponents because it feels like such a
monumental waste of time when I inevitably lose because I never play, as
you can see it is a vicious cycle. But maybe I could have a good time in an
5v5 game just building as many moonwells in hard to reach places as I can.
Also if we wanted to have a 5 of us v 5 b-net nubs, that would be cool.</dd>

also pick up some cheap $20 pork ribs because we&#8217;ll get a bit of mileage
out of &#8216;em.</p>
<p class="last">So, everyone pony up $10 or so for a slab of fantastic beef of Gatt&#8217;s
choosing.</p>

<dd>Every one is going to be on the same level for WCIII except Sullivan,
myself, and Jason (level of proficiency listed in order). You shouldn&#8217;t
worry about sucking.</dd>
<dt>Joeh</dt>
<dd>What if Rex comes? Isn&#8217;t he good too? Although i doubt the transponder
Kristen put on him extends all the way to Ogden?</dd>
<dt>MILKM3PLZ</dt>
<dd>Rex is virtually semi-professional. He is the best of us, hands down. But
he has no time and will not be coming, I&#8217;m guessing. If you want to know
how to play the Orcs, Rex will give you more advice than you know what to
do with.</dd>
<dt>+1 Luke of POWER!</dt>
<dd><p class="first">Yo!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m back from Europe! (Almost!)</p>
<p>I&#8217;m planning to be at this thing, and Lindsay wants to come and play Smash
Brothers and Mario Kart (and then probably distract me). Dawn of War sounds
cool, I suck at Warcraft III, D&amp;D Online sounds cool, Diablo II sounds
cool, I want to try some Wii games, I&#8217;ll be disappointed if I don&#8217;t play at
least one rollicking dota match, I&#8217;ll chip in for food, and I&#8217;ll plan on
making the commute between Ogden and SLC.</p>
<p class="last">Kisses to to you all.</p>
</dd>
<dt>MILKM3PLZ</dt>
<dd>Dawn of War Platinum is out. You can get both xpax and the game for $40, or
1 xpac and the game for $20 (gold edition).</dd>
<dt>whiteinge</dt>
<dd>What&#8217;s an xpax?</dd>
<dt>MILKM3PLZ</dt>
<dd>xpax = expansion packs</dd>
<dt>whiteinge</dt>
<dd><p class="first">Oh.</p>
<p class="last">You kids and your interweb slang!</p>
</dd>
<dt>Matt</dt>
<dd>Hehehehh?.he said interweb.</dd>
<dt>MILKM3PLZ</dt>
<dd><p class="first">So, Seth, now that this is imminent, I have a bunch of logistical
questions. I can help you figure things out if you want to call me or
something.</p>
<p>How many people are going? And how crowded will your house be, and will it
ventilation/temperature be a problem? Will it be too hot to sleep? Do we
all need to bring chairs? Do we need to bring tables? Are your tables and
chairs conducive to video gaming or are the tables really small or the
chairs really angled back (etc)? Do those who are going to sleep over have
space appropriate to their needs? Do you have enough food or a plan for how
food will be handled, and if so, what is it exactly? Do we need to bring
TVs for consoles or do we have enough (maybe we should figure out what
&#8220;enough&#8221; is, too)? Is there space to comfortably play on consoles and
computers while allowing walkways and space for people to scoot chairs back
if they need to? Do we have enough outlets and cables for everyone, and do
the cords stretch as far as they will need to?</p>
<p class="last">If I think of more potential issues we can nip in the bud, I&#8217;ll post them.</p>
</dd>
<dt>whiteinge</dt>
<dd>Thanks, James. I&#8217;ve updated the post to reflect this info.</dd>
<dt>MILKM3PLZ</dt>
<dd>Lol, &#8220;boxen.&#8221;</dd>
<dt>4ngryk0ng</dt>
<dd>i can bring my tv if needed. it&#8217;s an LCD screen, so it&#8217;s light and movable,
and will give us another tv to rot our brains with.</dd>
<dt>Jose Publico</dt>
<dd>Hey guys, drop everything! I have found the answer to our LAN dilema. We
will all play abbatia, at www.abbatia.net it?s a game in which you build a
medieval monestary and tend to your monks, their animals and you try to
copy and translate various religious texts. ?Que te aproveche! Co?os.</dd>
<dt>MILKM3PLZ</dt>
<dd>Now&#8217;s the time to get WCIII and Dawn of War installed.</dd>
<dt>Thais</dt>
<dd>I recommend all to bring a comfortable chair. We&#8217;ve got plenty, but after a
few hours it might hurt?unless if your butts are made of what Seth&#8217;s butt
is, (he can handle it &#8211;programmer&#8217;s butt).</dd>
<dt>Thais</dt>
<dd>Opss? didn&#8217;t check the Equipment part? and Jose, voce deve dizer ao seu
amigo Seth que ele tem que aprender portugues para que ele entenda o que
estou dizendo quando estou falando mal da irma chata delej</dd>
<dt>whiteinge</dt>
<dd>Thanks for offering the TV, Jason! I think that will really make the
consoling.</dd>
<dt>MILKM3PLZ</dt>
<dd>I&#8217;m thinking of fun party ideas, like little contests to determine who gets
to choose the next &#8220;all hero X&#8221; dota game. Hopefully I&#8217;ll come up with
something fun. I plan on typing up another survey for the Dota On-going Nub
Gauging System (DONGS), as well.</dd>
